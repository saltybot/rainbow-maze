* Stars are in the path and make you dizzy for 3 seconds.
* You have 1 minute to make it to the end; goal is to get the gold coin at the end of the path
* The knight guards the gold coin. you must defeat the knight!!
* You have tools to destroy the knight; the knight has tools to destroy you
    * shield; the knight has a sword, the shield can be used so the sword will go against the shield, not you
    * sword; stabs and kills the knight
    * hats; you put the hat over the knight's head and get behind him and get the coin
    * crowns; throw it and bang the knight on the head; sneak up behind the knight and get the coin while he's in pain; kind of like a boomerrang
    * helmet; helps to protect your head, and bangs the knight's head harder, and you have extra time to celebrate when you get the coin
* the unicorn gives you extra time
* you can only walk on the rainbow path because it's a maze
